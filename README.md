# MECE404_WallE_Bot
Arduino program and physical build instructions for final build project of undergraduate robotics coursework

Robot Build:
-MeArm multi-axis Arm (repairs & replacement on provided servo motors NEEDED)
-58mm Omni Directional Wheels
-HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ping Sesnors
-HMC5883L Magnetic Compass Module
-Parallax Continous Servo Motors
-Arduino ATMega2560

Code operation follows the provided flowchart flow for scanning and detection
Precision parking and grabbing requires additional sensory inclusion
Robot designed for open-world operation on any flat surface with no nearby walls
HMC5883L configured to sensor low level ferrous metal distortions in magnetic readings
Accurate readings of magnetic sensing requires sufficent iron sampling to be present
No additional libraries needed beyond those currntly specified
